      <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
      . What is Machine Learning :
      <br />
      Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates
      analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence
      based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns
      and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
      <br />

      . Why is ML important:
      <br />
      1.> Growing volumes and varieties of available data
      <br />
      2.> A cheaper and more powerful process for Computing the huge data
      <br />
      3.> Affordable data storage
      <br />
      All these factors have led for ML to be a crucial technology is this
      day and age.
      <br />

      We at Linkcode build precise models , which have the capability to
      analyze bigger, more complex data. We deliver faster and more accurate
      results even on a very large scale.

      <h2>IoT</h2>
      <p>
        The Internet of Things has become one of the most booming
        technologies. It has connected all kinds of devices to man. IoT
        promises to provide a platform that promotes efficiency, economic
        benefits and minimizes the human efforts for daily tasks. We add
        intelligence to our products using IoT. Considering the potential
        that IoT promises in human lives , Linkcode provides solution in
        various areas using Iot like :-
        <br />
        1.> Home Automation
        <br />
        2.> IoT security
        <br />
        3.> Healthcare
        <br />
        4.> RFID
        <br />
        5.> Agriculture to name a few.
        <br />

        Using these technology we cater the business requirements of our
        clients efficiently. We use reliable platforms like these and
        develop an ideal product for our clients. We firmly believe in
        ethical coding standards and client satisfaction.

      <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
      <p>
        . What is AI:
        <br />

        Artificial Intelligence is a subject of Computer Science aimed at
        building machines and computers that can enhance logical operations.
        AI systems have the ability to execute tasks naturally associated
        with human intelligence, like speech recognition, decision-making,
        visual perception, and translating languages.AI makes it possible
        for machines to adapt to new inputs and perform human-like tasks
        (even better).
        <br />
        We at Linkcode take into account the convergence of people, process
        and technology and develop strategies to effectively use AI to
        benefit our clients by embedding smartness into machines.
        <br />
        AI is used in :-
        <br />
        1.>Security Intelligence
        <br />
        2.>Investment Analysis
        <br />
        3.>Bots and smart machines
        <br />
        4.>Medical field
        <br />
        5.>Decision support systems
        <br />
        6.>Smart search systems are a few applications

      <h2>Angular JS</h2>

      <p>
        This technology is known for its flexility,scalability and
        implementation of the most crucial MVC model. Angular is a trending
        technology launched by Google to develop single page Web
        Applictions, Mobile Applications,etc.
      </p>
      <h2>React JS</h2>
      <p>
        On the other side React JS is not a framework, it is a JavaScript
        library that is used for building the user interfaces. It is open
        source and provides high-performance client and server side
        rendering.
        <br />
        Why Angular Js And React Js?
        <br />
        With time, emergence of new technology takes place which saves the
        developers the time and cost of the development.
        <br />
        The purpose of using Angular and React is that it has features like:
        <br />
        -Dependency Injection
        <br />
        -Form Validation
        <br />
        -Directives
        <br />
        -Light weight code base
        <br />
        -Data Binding
        <br />
        -Controller and routes
        <br />
